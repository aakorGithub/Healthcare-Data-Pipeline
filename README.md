# Healthcare-Data-Pipeline

This document outlines the functionality of a simple healthcare data pipeline system designed to simulate patient data ingestion, processing, compliance, security, and integration with medical billing and queue systems. The system operates on data in JSON format and mimics the steps involved in managing patient records while considering security protocols and HIPAA compliance.

# Data Pipeline Ingestion
Purpose:
The ingestData function simulates the process of ingesting patient data from a healthcare providerâ€™s system. It organizes the data into a structured format and stores it in a Map object, making it easy to access and manage individual patient records.

# Functionality:

Accepts four arrays: patientID, age, medicalrecordID, and https_source.
For each patient, creates an object containing their details (age, medicalrecordID, and https_source).
Stores each patient's data in a Map using the patientID as the key.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
const patientID = ['Jason Peter'];
const age = [33];
const medicalrecordID = ['1000347'];
const https_source = ['kaiserpermanente.org'];

console.log(ingestData(patientID, age, medicalrecordID, https_source));
Output:

json
Copy code
Map {
  'Jason Peter' => {
    age: 33,
    medicalrecordID: '1000347',
    https_source: 'kaiserpermanente.org'
  }
}
2. Data Processing and Error Handling
Purpose:
The processPatientsrecord function simulates the processing of patient records based on HIPAA compliance and security protocols. It handles both successful processing and errors based on the record type and HIPAA approval status.

Functionality:

Uses a Promise to simulate asynchronous behavior when processing patient records.
If the record is private and HIPAA-approved, it resolves after a timeout.
If the record is "at risk" and HIPAA approval is violated, it rejects with an error message.
Otherwise, it resolves with a generic message indicating the record is secured.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
processPatientsrecord('Private', 'Approved')
  .then(message => console.log(message))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
Output:

text
Copy code
Patient record is sealed
3. Compliance and Security Processes
Purpose:
The grantAccess function checks if user credentials meet the security requirements, including verifying the user ID, username, and password. This function mimics the process of granting or denying access to sensitive healthcare data based on security compliance.

Functionality:

Accepts arrays of usersID, usersname, and password.
Checks if the user ID contains 'JeMa', if the username contains '@', and if the password also contains '@'.
Returns "Access Approved" if all conditions are met; otherwise, it returns "Deny Access!".
Example:

javascript
Copy code
let usersID = ['Jerry Maddison'];
let usersname = ['eric@cybersystem.ord'];
let password = ['@madij90llp'];

console.log(grantAccess(usersID, usersname, password));
Output:

text
Copy code
Access Approved
4. Output Integration and Database Fetch
Purpose:
The getMedicalbill function simulates output integration by creating and logging an object with a medical bill message and its associated queue status.

Functionality:

Accepts two parameters: message and queue, both of which are arrays.
Extracts the first element from both arrays to form a structured object.
Logs the message object and the queue to the console.
